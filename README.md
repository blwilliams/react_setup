## Installing ZSH and Oh-My-ZSH for Terminal (optional):
This guide will walk you through installing **Zsh**, setting it as your default shell, and configuring **Oh My Zsh** on macOS. It makes working in the terminal much nicer.

### Step 0: Install Homebrew (if not installed)
Open a terminal and install __Homebrew__ (if you haven't already):
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Then, update Homebrew:
```sh
brew update
```

### Step 1: Check if Zsh is Installed

macOS comes with **Zsh** pre-installed. To verify, open the terminal and run:

```sh
zsh --version
```

If you see a version number (e.g., `zsh 5.8` or higher), **Zsh is already installed**.

If it's not installed, proceed to the next step.

---

### Step 2: Install Zsh (If Needed)

If Zsh is not installed or you want to update it, install it using **Homebrew**:

```sh
brew install zsh
```

After installation, check the version again:

```sh
zsh --version
```

---

### Step 3: Set Zsh as the Default Shell

To make **Zsh** the default shell, run:

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Then, restart your terminal or log out and log back in.

To confirm that Zsh is now the default shell, run:

```sh
echo $SHELL
```

If it returns `/bin/zsh` (or `/usr/local/bin/zsh` for Homebrew installations), then itâ€™s set correctly.

---

### Step 4: Install Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh is a popular Zsh configuration framework that enhances Zsh with themes and plugins.

Install it using:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Alternatively, if you prefer **wget**, use:

```sh
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

---

### Step 5: Choose a Theme (Optional)

Oh My Zsh includes multiple themes. The default theme is `robbyrussell`, but you can change it.

1. Open the Zsh configuration file in a text editor:

   ```sh
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Locate the line that starts with:

   ```sh
   ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
   ```

3. Change `"robbyrussell"` to another theme, such as `"agnoster"` or `"powerlevel10k"` (after installing it).

4. Save the file (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

5. Apply the changes:

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

For a list of themes, visit the [Oh My Zsh themes page](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes).

---

### Step 6: Enable Plugins (Optional)

Oh My Zsh has many useful plugins. To enable them:

1. Open the `~/.zshrc` file:

   ```sh
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Find the `plugins` section:

   ```sh
   plugins=(git)
   ```

3. Add other plugins, such as:

   ```sh
   plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
   ```

4. Save and apply the changes:

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Install Recommended Plugins:

- **zsh-autosuggestions** (suggests commands as you type):

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
  ```

- **zsh-syntax-highlighting** (highlights command syntax):

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
  ```

Then, add them to the `plugins=(...)` section in `~/.zshrc` and run:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### Step 7: Install Powerlevel10k (Optional, but Recommended)

**Powerlevel10k** is a popular, customizable Zsh theme.

1. Install Powerlevel10k:

   ```sh
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
   ```

2. Set it as your theme in `~/.zshrc`:

   ```sh
   ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
   ```

3. Save the file and restart your terminal:

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. Follow the **Powerlevel10k** configuration wizard to customize your prompt.

---

### Step 8: Restart Your Terminal and Enjoy ðŸŽ‰

Now that Zsh and Oh My Zsh are installed and configured, restart your terminal and enjoy your new shell!

To verify that everything is working:

```sh
echo $SHELL
```

If it returns `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/local/bin/zsh`, you're all set!

# Install Prerequisits
## Node.js & npm

Next.js requires __Node.js__ (LTS version recommended). Install it using Homebrew:
```sh
brew install node
```
Check versions:
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```
Alternatively, you can install __Node Version Manager (nvm)__ for managing multiple Node versions:
```sh
brew install nvm
mkdir ~/.nvm
echo 'export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
Then, install Node.js:
```sh
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

```sh
mkdir -p ~/code/react
cd ~/code/react
```

Then, create a new Next.js app with TypeScript (optional but recommended):
```sh
npx create-next-app@latest penpal
```

You will be asked a series of questions, answer in the following way:
